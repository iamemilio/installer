# OpenStack Platform Support

Support for launching clusters on OpenStack is **experimental**.

This document discusses the requirements, current expected behavior, and how to
try out what exists so far.

## OpenStack Requirements

The installer assumes the following about the OpenStack cloud you run against:

* You must create a `clouds.yaml` file with the auth URL and credentials
    necessary to access the OpenStack cloud you want to use.  Information on
    this file can be found at
    https://docs.openstack.org/os-client-config/latest/user/configuration.html
    and it looks like:
```
clouds:
  shiftstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://10.10.14.42:5000/v3
      project_name: shiftstack
      username: shiftstack_user
      password: XXX
      user_domain_name: Default
      project_domain_name: Default
  dev-evn:
    region_name: RegionOne
    auth:
      username: 'devuser'
      password: XXX
      project_name: 'devonly'
      auth_url: 'https://10.10.14.22:5001/v2.0'
```

* Swift must be enabled.  The user must have `swiftoperator` permissions and
  `temp-url` support must be enabled. As an OpenStack admin:
  * `openstack role add --user <user> --project <project> swiftoperator`
  * `openstack object store account set --property Temp-URL-Key=superkey`

**NOTE:** Swift is required as the user-data provided by OpenStack is not big
enough to store the ignition config files, so they are served by swift instead.

* You may need to increase the security group related quotas from their default
  values. For example (as an OpenStack admin) `openstack quota set --secgroups 100 --secgroup-rules 1000 <project>`

* The installer requires a proper RHCOS image in the OpenStack cluster or project:
`openstack image create --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 --file redhat-coreos-${RHCOSVERSION}-openstack.qcow2 redhat-coreos-${RHCOSVERSION}`

**NOTE:** Depending on your OpenStack environment you can upload the RHCOS image
as `raw` or `qcow2`. See [https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/image-formats.html](Disk and container formats for images) for more information.

* The public network should be created by the OSP admin. Verify the name/ID of the 'External' network:
```
openstack network list --long -c ID -c Name -c "Router Type"
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
| ID                                   | Name           | Router Type |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
| 148a8023-62a7-4672-b018-003462f8d7dc | public_network | External    |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
```

## Current Expected Behavior

As mentioned, OpenStack support is still experimental. Currently:

* Deploys an isolated tenant network
* Deploys a instance used as a 'service VM' that hosts a load balancer for the
OpenShift API and as an internal DNS for the instances
* Deploys a bootstrap instance to bootstrap the OpenShift cluster
* Deploys 3 master nodes
* Once the masters are deployed, the bootstrap instance is destroyed

The installer fails to end gracefully as the openshift-console is not deployed
because there are no nodes available.

**NOTE** The worker nodes are still a WIP

### Workarounds
While deploying the cluster, the installer will hang trying to reach the API as
the node running the installer cannot resolve the service VM (the cluster
should still come up successfully within the isolated network). As a temporary
workaround you can add the service VM floating IP and hostname to the
`/etc/hosts` file as:

```
$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
10.19.115.117 <cluster-name>-api.<domain>
```

If you do expose the cluster, the installer should make it far enough along to
bring up the HA control plane and tear down the bootstrap node.  It will then
hang waiting for the console to come up.

```
DEBUG Still waiting for the console route: the server is currently unable to
handle the request (get routes.route.openshift.io)
...
FATAL waiting for openshift-console URL: context deadline exceeded
```

## Using an External Load Balancer

This documents how to shift from the api VM load balancer (which is not
HA) to an external load balancer.

The load balancer must serve ports 6443, 443, and 80 to any users of
the system.  Port 49500 is for serving ignition startup configurations
to the OpenShift nodes and should not be reachable by the outside world.

The first step is to add floating IPs to all the master nodes. Usually
the public network here is named 'public':

* `openstack floating ip create --port master-port-0 <public network>`
* `openstack floating ip create --port master-port-1 <public network>`
* `openstack floating ip create --port master-port-2 <public network>`

Once complete you can see your floating IPs using:

* `openstack server list`

These floating IPs can then be used by the load balancer to access
the cluster.  An example haproxy configuration for port 6443 is below.
The other port configurations are identical.

```
listen <cluster name>-api-6443
    bind 0.0.0.0:6443
    mode tcp
    stats enable
    stats uri /haproxy?status
    balance roundrobin
    server ostest-master-2 <floating ip>:6443 check
    server ostest-master-0 <floating ip>:6443 check
    server ostest-master-1 <floating ip>:6443 check
```

Next step is to allow access to the network the load balancer is on:

* `openstack security group rule create master --remote-ip <subnet CIDR> --ingress --protocol tcp --dst-port 6443`
* `openstack security group rule create master --remote-ip <subnet CIDR> --ingress --protocol tcp --dst-port 443`
* `openstack security group rule create master --remote-ip <subnet CIDR> --ingress --protocol tcp --dst-port 80`

Where subnet CIDR is the network the load balancer is on.  You could
also specify a specific IP address with /32 if you wish.

You can verify the operation of the load balancer now if you wish, using the
curl commands given below.

Now the DNS entry for <cluster name>-api.<base domain> needs to be updated
to point to the new load balancer.  In our case the cluster name is
'ostest' and the domain is 'shiftstack.com':

* `<load balancer ip> ostest-api.shiftstack.com`

The external load balancer should now be operation along with your own
DNS solution.  It's best to test this configuration before removing
the api. The following curl command is an example of how
to check functionality:

`curl https://<loadbalancer-ip>:6443/version --insecure`

Result:

```json
{
  "major": "1",
  "minor": "11+",
  "gitVersion": "v1.11.0+ad103ed",
  "gitCommit": "ad103ed",
  "gitTreeState": "clean",
  "buildDate": "2019-01-09T06:44:10Z",
  "goVersion": "go1.10.3",
  "compiler": "gc",
  "platform": "linux/amd64"
}
```

Another useful thing to check is that the ignition configurations are only
available from within the deployment:

* `curl https://<loadbalancer ip>:49500/config/master --insecure`

Now that the DNS and load balancer has been moved, we can take down the existing
api VM:

* `openstack server delete <cluster name>-api`
